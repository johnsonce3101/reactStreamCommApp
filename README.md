# reactStreamCommApp

An all in one platform for creaters to place various forms of content and build a community around their content

## Description

A deployed(Netlify), dynamic web application that allows a user to make a donation using a pseudo payment method via the sandbox PayPal API. With embedded youtube videos a user is able to see and hear content. The is also embedded soundcloud audio for a user to listen to. Currently I have a dumby merchandise t-shirt for a user to view. Each link will take you to more content; videos, audio, merch. However the two links titled IG and tiktok will take you to live feed of the administrators instagram pages. Lastly on the home page if you click the join virtchat button a user will be redirected to VIRTCHAT. A user will have to log in with a user name and password(previously sent out via link by the administrator, yours truly, to be created). Once the correct credentials are entered a user will be taken to a chat room were they can send messages upload images to a chat room of their choosing. The administrator has the ability to delete rooms, change the names of chats, and remove users from specific chats or alltogether.
